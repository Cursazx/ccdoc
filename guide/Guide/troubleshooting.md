# Troubleshooting
Since our bot is very advanced, everyone faces there own problems. Because of this, we made a section, with some common problems. Sorted from most common to less common

The problem is the title, the answer is below it & after the question is the trigger type:

## My command does not triggers <Badge type="tip" text="Word" vertical="middle" /> 
Have you set the minimium permission for the command execution to `None`?

- No: change it, press save & try again

- Yes: check if your trigger contains any [special characters](../CodeReferences/specialCharacters)
